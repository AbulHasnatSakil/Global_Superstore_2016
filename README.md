# Project_On:
# Global Superstore 2016
# Aim:
#### The aim of this project is to analyse the data with respect to the sales and profit after filtering some of the columns.
#### The data 'global_superstore_2016' consists of 51290 entries (that is rows) and total 24 columns. The columns Order Date & Ship Date are not in one specific format and also in Datetime type, your job is to convert these columns to the Datetime objects first. 
#### And in the second stage, the columns 'Sales' and 'Profit' consist of special symbols like [  '$',"(", and ")"] so filter these columns and convert them into an either int or float type. After converting these columns into an int or float type remove the columns which are not necessary with respect the data analysis. After doing this cleaning process, analyse the data with respect to the following analysing questions.

#### Observe the columns 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' :
